# HEALTHCHECK for use in `docker ps`, `docker-compose ps`, or a readiness probe in k8s.
#
# The following environment variables are read from pid 1, which means they must be ENV in docker
# or exported in the ENTRYPOINT implementation:
# * HEALTHCHECK_KIND - must be "http" or "tcp". Defaults to "http"
#   * When "http" the GET path to check is /health
# * HEALTHCHECK_IP - Defaults to $(hostname -i || 127.0.0.1)
# * HEALTHCHECK_PORT - Not always the service port, but in Zipkin it typically is. No default
#
# Setup like this:
# # We use a 30s start period to avoid marking the container unhealthy on slow or contended CI hosts
#  HEALTHCHECK --interval=1s --start-period=30s --timeout=5s CMD ["docker-healthcheck"]
#
# Note: this is named docker-healthcheck, not docker_healthcheck like our other scripts. That's due
# to conventions in https://github.com/docker-library/healthcheck/

# Fail on unset variables, but don't quit on rc!=0, so we can log what happened
set -u +e

# get pid 1 env as this is run dependent on ENTRYPOINT
export `cat /proc/1/environ| tr '\0' '\n'| \
  egrep '^(HEALTHCHECK_KIND|HEALTHCHECK_IP|HEALTHCHECK_PORT)='`

ip=${HEALTHCHECK_IP:-$(hostname -i || echo '127.0.0.1')}
